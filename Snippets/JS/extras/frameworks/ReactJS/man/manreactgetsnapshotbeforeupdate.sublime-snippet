  ======================================

		getSnapshotBeforeUpdate:

    Itâ€™s called between render and the 
    updated component actually being 
    propagated to the DOM. 

    It exists as a last-chance-look at 
    your component with its previous 
    props and state.

    Most Common Use Case: Taking a look 
    at some attribute of the current DOM, 
    and passing that value on to componentDidUpdate.

    You should either return 'null' or a value
    from getSnapshotBeforeUpdate.
